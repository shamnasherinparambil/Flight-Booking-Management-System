    Welcome Flight Booking Management System!!
</p>
<p>
    A flight management system (FMS) is a fundamental component of a modern airliner's avionics. 
    An FMS is a specialized computer system that automates a wide variety of in-flight tasks, 
    reducing the workload on the flight crew to the point that modern civilian aircraft no longer 
    carry flight engineers or navigators. A primary function is in-flight management of the flight plan. 
    Using various sensors (such as GPS and INS often backed up by radio navigation) to determine the 
    aircraft's position, the FMS can guide the aircraft along the flight plan. From the cockpit, 
    the FMS is normally controlled through a Control Display Unit (CDU) which incorporates a small 
    screen and keyboard or touchscreen. The FMS sends the flight plan for display to the Electronic
     Flight Instrument System (EFIS), Navigation Display (ND), or Multifunction Display (MFD). 
     The FMS can be summarised as being a dual system consisting of the Flight Management Computer (FMC),
      CDU and a cross talk bus.
